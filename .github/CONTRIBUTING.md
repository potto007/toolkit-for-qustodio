Contributions are greatly welcomed!

### Bug Reports
First, make sure the bug you're reporting hasn't already been submitted. If you
can't find the issue, submit a [new issue](https://github.com/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab/issues/new)
and follow the template that is provided.

### Feature Requests
Feature requests are best suited in the [forums](http://forum.youneedabudget.com/categories/ynab-extensions).
But can also be submitted as issues. Please properly name your issue
as `FEATURE REQUEST: [title]`.

### Contributing Code
If you want to contribute, it's best if you can let us know what you're
working on so we don't double up on effort.

You can see what is being worked on and by whom on the
[roadmap](https://trello.com/b/EzOvXlil/toolkit-for-ynab-roadmap).

If you can't find what you want to build on the roadmap, feel free to put
a note up on the github issues board to let the team know you're working
on something new.

When your code is ready, submit a pull request. You can also contact
@blarg on [the YNAB forums](http://forum.youneedabudget.com).

You can find documentation on how to build features [here](https://github.com/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab/blob/master/docs/building-features.md).
